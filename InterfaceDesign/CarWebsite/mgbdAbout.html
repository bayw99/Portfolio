<p style= "text-align: center; background-color: beige; padding:10px; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; ">We have over 30 years experience of owning, repairing, restoring and running Rover P6 cars in all variants, 2000, 2200 & 3500, saloon and estate, both as everyday and show condition cars and also over 30 experience within classic car clubs. That experience forms the back bone of our specialist Rover P6 parts business  'MGBD Parts', that is in turn dedicated to supplying quality parts for all variants of the Rover P6 built between 1963-1977 as well as help and advice. We stock predominantly brand new manufactured items but also some second hand parts {SH} and  also a small mix of  'NOS' (New Old Stock). We also do some refurbishment work to some parts while also offering a rechroming service and also workshop services, but if you can't see what you need please email us  
<br>
<br>
    Please note that all Refurbished, NOS and Secondhand parts are detailed as such, and therefore anything else listed is a brand new manufactured item.  Please click on the categories list on the left or use the product search facility to look through our items by description or part number. The vast majority of our parts are listed by the original Rover part numbers that were used in the Rover Parts catalogues, however if you don't find what you are looking for, please call us or drop us an email.
 <br>  
 <br> 
    The webshop also has a facility for you  to register as a 'user' and by doing this, we can save your contact details for future purchases [but we don't save your card details] and then you'll only have to log in, which saves you time when you are purchasing parts. You can also save your 'shopping basket' and return at a later time if you need to. Please check out our 'Important Customer Information' and 'Privacy' pages for the legal stuff,  especially about the new GDPR rules. The shop has been live since July 2012 and has new items being added often  so you really do need to refresh your browser everytime you visit. We have set up a comprehensive set of shipping rates for single and multiple purchases but please contact us if a shipping cost doesn't seem right, [please note shipping rates to outside the UK should be viewed as guidelines as we will always seek to sort the best value shipping rate. We attend many events throughout the year so to save costs on shipping, you can arrange to meet us at these events and collect your parts. Plus since January 2019 we have our shop facility in Dixon Street , Wolverhampton, where you are always welcome to call in and pick up your order..  Please call or email If you don't see what you need or if you just need technical advice. </p>
